# cocos-creator-tiled-map-animation

This example extends Tiled Map component into TiledMapExt in folder `assets/Script/TiledMapExt`. The new component can be used exactly like original one, but it can display animated tile, which is a new feature in Tiled Map Editor that Cocos Creator has not supported yet.
